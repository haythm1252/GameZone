# GameZone Project

**GameZone** is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that I developed as part of a learning project. This project was inspired by a YouTube tutorial, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL62tSREI9C-cQ21T5HIWqqBOHQiNMOhBG).

## Features:
- **Create**: Users can add new games to the system.
- **Read**: The system allows users to view a list of all games with a **details page** for each game.
- **Update**: Users can update game information through an edit form.
- **Delete**: Games can be deleted from the system.
  
## Image Management:
- **Add Images**: Users can add images for each game while creating or editing the game details.
- **Edit Images**: Users can update the images for the games by selecting new images when editing the game.
- **Delete Images**: Users can remove images associated with a game.
- **Custom Image Upload**: I implemented a custom method for uploading and deleting images, which is different from the method used in the tutorial playlist. This allows for greater control over image management.

## Client Libraries Used:
- **Select2**: Enhances dropdown menus for better user experience.
- **SweetAlert2**: Used for interactive confirmation modals (like the delete confirmation).

## Views:
- **Show View**: Displays a list of all games.
- **Edit View**: Allows users to modify existing games, including changing images.

This project demonstrates the basic operations of a CRUD application with an emphasis on a clean and responsive user interface, as well as robust image management features.
